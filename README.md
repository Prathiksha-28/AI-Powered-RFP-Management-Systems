# AI-Powered-RFP-Management_Systems
A single-user web application that streamlines the end-to-end RFP (Request for Proposal) process using AI. Users can create RFPs in natural language, manage vendors, send RFPs via email, automatically parse vendor responses, and compare proposals with AI-assisted recommendations.
# Project Overview
Many procurement processes are slow, error-prone, and repetitive due to unstructured data from emails, PDFs, and free-form vendor responses. This project:

Converts natural language RFP descriptions into structured JSON.

Maintains vendor master data and sends RFPs via email.

Automatically parses messy vendor responses using AI.

Compares proposals and recommends vendors based on pricing, delivery, terms, and completeness.
